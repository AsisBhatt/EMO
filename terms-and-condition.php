We will normally verify prices, availability and confirm there are no errors on the product page as part of our dispatch procedures.</p>
							<p>Where a product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the product to you. If a product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection. We are under no obligation to provide the product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you an <strong>Order Confirmation</strong> or a <strong>Shipping Confirmation</strong>, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognized by you as a pricing error.</p>
							<p>Order for processing, but your order is subsequently cancelled due to unavailability of product. You acknowledge that products may sell quickly and there may be a short period of time after an order has been submitted, but where the product is no longer available. You agree that we may cancel your order after you have received an <strong>Order Confirmation</strong> without penalty. On very rare occasions, you may receive a <strong>Shipping Confirmation</strong> from us, but the product is no longer available in our or our third party fulfillment provider's inventory. You agree that we may rescind our acceptance and cancel your order without penalty if we are unable to ship the product you ordered due to unavailability.</p>
							<p>We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions on a product page. We reserve the right to rescind our acceptance and cancel your order without penalty in the event there is an obvious and unmistakable error on the product page, in our reasonable discretion. If you have already received your order, we will do our best to resolve your concern.</p>
							<h4>COLLECTION OF TAX</h4>
							<p>In states where we have no physical presence, we are not required to collect and remit sales tax for purchases. However, many states require that their residents file a sales or use tax return for items purchased on this Site. You should consult your state and local tax laws to determine compliance with tax laws and regulations in your area. In some states we collect and remit sales tax. For purchases where sales tax is applicable you will see the tax calculated on the checkout page before you are asked to confirm the purchase. We use reasonable commercial efforts to calculate and remit the correct amount of tax required on each taxable purchase, but we do not guarantee the accuracy of the amount of the tax we represent to you as the tax owed. Minor errors may occur owing to the inability to accurately track multiple taxing districts, state and local "tax holidays," the timing of rate changes or the application of certain taxes to categories of items we sell. As a result of any error, we may over collect or under collect your tax. In consideration of our allowing you access to and use of the Site, and in collecting and remitting taxes required on your purchases, you hereby waive your right to claim that the tax collected on any purchase is incorrect in any respect and agree to hold us harmless, our officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, for any harm or other damages you may incur as a result of our error in calculating the taxes you owe for your purchases.</p>

							<p>That's why eData Business Media Group has a no tolerance spam policy.</p>
							<h5>What is Spam?</h5>
							<p>Spam is often in the eye of the beholder. If you ask ten different people for a definition of Spam, you'll probably get ten different answers. So here’s our best explanation:</p>
							<p>Spam, as applied to email, means "Unsolicited Bulk Email".</p>
							<p>Unsolicited means that the recipient has not granted the sender affirmative consent (permission) to email them.</p>
							<p>Bulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages, all having materially similar content.</p>
							<h5>Reporting Abuse</h5>
							<p>If you feel a eData Business Media Group customer is sending unsolicited email, you can report it to us by sending it to <a href="mailto:abuse@edatamediagroup.com">abuse@edatamediagroup.com</a>. Each email is reviewed and cataloged by a member of the Compliance Team. In addition, we will investigate each complaint and take appropriate action against the sender.</p>
